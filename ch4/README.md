## Special Orthogonal Group SO(3)
1. definition:
    SO(3) is a group of 3*3 orthogonal matrices with determinant of 1. These matrices represent the rotation in a space.

2. qualities:
    Matrix R in SO(3) satisfied $R^TR = RR^T = I$, and $det(R) = 1$

3. applications:
    SO(3) describes a rotation in a 3D space, which is irrelevant to shifts.
