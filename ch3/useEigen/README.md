matrix basic concept:

Geometrical meaning of 
1. determinant:
    volume of the scaling factors
2. trace:
    sum of the scaling factors along each dimensions
3. inverse:
    the reverse linear transformation 
4. transpose:
     linear transformations, a matrix represents a linear mapping from one vector space to another. The transpose of a matrix essentially represents the same linear transformation, but with respect to the dual spaces. 
5. dot product of u and v:
    the scale that u and v points to the same direction (along the same dimension).
