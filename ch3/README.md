## Euler Angles
Explained by UPenn engineering Professor, link: [https://youtu.be/3Zjf95Jw2UE?si=_8DwyzLceRrJRq-l]

If we know the order of the rotations (e.g ZXY), and the $R_{33}$ is neither 1 nor -1: then we have 2 sets of possible Euler angles
Yet if ${R_{33}}$ is +-1: then there might have infinite set of possible Euler anlges.

Groups of symmetries are composite, combining symmetries can generate another symmetries in a group.
