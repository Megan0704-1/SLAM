## Euler Angles
Explained by UPenn engineering Professor, link: [https://youtu.be/3Zjf95Jw2UE?si=_8DwyzLceRrJRq-l]

If we know the order of the rotations (e.g ZXY), and the $R_{33}$ is neither 1 nor -1: then we have 2 sets of possible Euler angles
Yet if ${R_{33}}$ is +-1: then there might have infinite set of possible Euler anlges.

## Groups

Groups of symmetries are composite, combining symmetries can generate another symmetries in a group.

## Quarternions
Explained by 3b1b, link[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg]

real number + 3 imaginary parts = 4 hypershere
we should comprehend the hypershpere in 3 dimensional space as a projection
E.g. 
    i*j = k
    thumb points from origin to i (unit sphere)
    imagine a circle draw from j
    scale line with the thumb position meanwhile rotate the point lies on j: reaches k!
